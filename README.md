# Calories Calculator
 Team project - REST API development

As people are becoming more aware of the importance of daily workout and keeping their
weight under control, it is helpful to provide information regarding calories
burned during various exercise activities. This data can be combined with calories
consumed with food to develop effective weight management programs. 

This Calculator will show the users how many calories they used up while exercising.
They will be able to select a type of exercise from a comprehensive list to provide accurate estimate. 
The following formula will be used Total Calories Burned = METS x weight (kg) x time (hours) 
Where METS is number of kcal / kg / hour and will be obtained for different physical activities from a DataBase table??? XML file???.  

##Project Goal:
Create REST API to calculate total calorie expenditure for different sports activities.
This API will enable third-party developers to build applications..
